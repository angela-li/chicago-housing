About this repository
---------------------

This repository contains the script produced during the R Spatial Workshop on October 30, 2018. Click on [`chicago-housing-explore.R`](https://github.com/angela-li/chicago-housing/blob/master/chicago-housing-explore.R) above to see the code produced in the workshop.

We'll be building out this script over multiple workshops. Expect more maps soon!

Additional resources
--------------------

-   To get a preview of what we'll be doing, check out Luc's tutorial for [Spatial Data Handling](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/lab_tutorials/1_R_Spatial_Data_Handling.html#community-area-population-data). We're working with different data, but the concepts are similar.

-   To get more familiar with dplyr, there's no better resource than [R for Data Science, chapter 5](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html). This book in general is *fantastic* and I recommend you give it a look.

-   To download more Chicago-related data, go to the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org)here.
